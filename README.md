# TNBC_RNAseq
RNA Seq analysis of Carboplatin-resistant versus Carboplatin-sensitive Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC).

This is part of the final assessment by BIO 485/BIO 585. Bioinformatics Principles at Miami University, Ohio in Spring 2022. The practice of differential transcript expression was implemented via Ballgown package, with isoform-level assembly files (transcriptome) through Stingtie alogrithm. The DE will be solely based on FPKM values instead of gene counts like the DESeq2 package.

With that saying, we have tried to compared the outcomes of the 2 pacakges at the end regarding rankings, network in GSEA, or evem just the overlapping results. We have not publicly uploaded the code yet as we are all busy with school and works, but we will try out best for the sake of code transparency in the bioinformatics community or the general audience.
